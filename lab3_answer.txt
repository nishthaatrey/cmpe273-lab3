When I sent message from client in Multicast UDP when server is not available, I received the following output:



C:\Users\Nishtha Atrey\Desktop\Python 3>python multicast_udp_client.py

Datagram 'Client: Ping' received from ('10.0.0.26', 8888)



Which means that the client received the message sent by itself, as the client is also a part of the multicast address group 
and the messages will by received by all the listeners in the group including the client as well.
